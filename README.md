# OCN 682 Final Project

This is a repository dedicated to my final project for OCN 682. 
For my final project, I will be using data from my thesis collected over the summer of 2024 from Limahuli Valley on Kauaâ€˜i. 


## My three outputs for this project are:
* a color package for the native Hawaiian plants found in these surveys
   - Unfortunately, the package itself is in a standalone repo, but the code is in the scripts folder, as well as a detailed description in the project description file also in the scrips folder. (see link below)
     
* a shiny app
   - charts showcasing the relationship between vascular plant seedlings and bryophytes

* a barplot to showcase results from surveys

* a bonus 4th output for the class presentation

## The main question of the project is: 
Are there significant associations between the presence/abundance of bryophytes and native vascular plants? 

Secondary questions include: 
1. Which flowering plant species are most associated with bryophytes?

2. How can this influence restoration techniques?
