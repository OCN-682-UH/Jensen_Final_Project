# OCN 682 Final Project

This is a repository dedicated to my final project for OCN 682. 
For my final project, I will be using data from my thesis collected over the summer of 2024 from Limahuli Valley on Kauaâ€˜i. 


## In this repository you will find:
* a color package for the native Hawaiian plants found in these surveys
   - I included 1 folder with the entire code and a description of what I did
   - Another folder contains the package. This one does not contain annotations but it identical. I included both of these for easier viewing. :)

* a shiny app
   - charts showcasing the relationship between vascular plant seedlings and bryophytes
 
   - 

## The main question of the project is: 
Are there significant associations between the presence/abundance of bryophytes and native vascular plants? 

Secondary questions include: 
1. Which flowering plant species are most associated with bryophytes?

2. How can this influence restoration techniques?
